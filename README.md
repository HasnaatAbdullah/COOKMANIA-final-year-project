**COOKMANIA** solves this problem by providing:  
✅ Smart **recipe recommendations** based on available ingredients  
✅ A **user-friendly mobile app** interface  
✅ A **machine learning-powered recommendation system**  

This project integrates **Java, Python, XML, SQLite, and Flask** to create a seamless recipe discovery experience.

## 🛑 Problem Statement  
Existing recipe applications and websites provide recipes based on **keywords** or **cuisine preferences**, but:  
- They **fail to recommend recipes** based on the **available ingredients**.  
- Users are often forced to **replace missing ingredients** manually.  
- This results in **less-than-ideal cooking experiences** and **food waste**.  

**COOKMANIA** fills this gap by implementing a **machine learning-driven recommendation system** that analyzes your available ingredients and suggests the **best possible recipes** automatically.
